#Q. 6:

#Traingle(Input and Output)

#The area of a triangle can be computed using the following formula, where b is the length of the base of the triangle, and h is its height:
#area = b* h/2
#Write a program that allows the user to enter values for b and h. The program should then compute and display the area of a triangle with base length b and height h.


b = int(input())
h = int(input())
print("The area of the triangle is",b*h/2)
